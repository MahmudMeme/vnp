@SAYYAMTAMIM,1,"د ملکي انجینر په توګه، تاسو ممکن په ودانیو یا زیربنایي پروژو کې د بریښنایی سیسټمونو په شرایطو کې د &quot;برقی ټیټ ولټاژ&quot; (ELV) اصطلاح سره مخ شئ. ELV د بریښنایی سیسټم هغه برخې ته اشاره کوي چې په نسبتا ټیټ ولتاژ کې فعالیت کوي، په ځانګړې توګه د 50 وولټ بدیل اوسني (AC) یا 120 وولټ مستقیم اوسني (DC) څخه کم. د دې ولتاژ حد د 230 ولټو AC یا ډیر لوړ بریښنایی بریښنا رسولو ولټاژ څخه د پام وړ ټیټ دی.<br><br>د ELV سیسټمونه په عمده ډول ډیزاین شوي ترڅو مختلف بریښنایی او مخابراتي تجهیزاتو ، کنټرول سیسټمونو ، او ټیټ بریښنا وسیلو ته بریښنا چمتو کړي. دا سیسټمونه د بریښنایی زیربناوو د اغیزمن فعالیت په یقیني کولو کې مهم رول لوبوي او د ودانیو مختلف دندو او خدماتو ملاتړ کوي.<br><br>د ELV سیسټمونو ځینې عام مثالونه پدې کې شامل دي:<br><br>1. د مخابراتو سیسټمونه: د ELV سیسټمونه مختلف مخابراتي شبکې لري لکه د تلیفون لاینونه، ډیټا شبکې، د انټرکام سیسټمونه، د عامه پتې (PA) سیسټمونه، او غږیز سیسټمونه. دا سیسټمونه د ودانۍ یا زیربنا پروژې دننه داخلي او بهرنۍ اړیکې اسانه کوي.<br><br>2. د امنیت او لاسرسي کنټرول سیسټمونه: د ELV سیسټمونه د امنیت او لاسرسي کنټرول اهدافو لپاره کارول کیږي ، پشمول د CCTV نظارت سیسټمونه ، د الارم سیسټمونه ، بریښنایی قفلونه او د بایومیټریک لاسرسي کنټرول سیسټمونه. دا سیسټمونه ودانیو ته د لاسرسي نظارت او کنټرول کې مرسته کوي او ټول امنیت ښه کوي.<br><br>3. د اور کشف او د الارم سیسټمونه: د ELV سیسټمونو کې د اور کشف سیسټمونه شامل دي چې د سګرټ کشف کونکي، د تودوخې کشف کونکي، د اور الارم، او بیړني رڼا شامل دي. دا سیسټمونه د اور د خطرونو د ژر کشف او په وخت د وتلو لپاره اړین دي.<br><br>4. د ودانولو اتومات سیسټمونه: د ELV سیسټمونه ممکن د ودانۍ اتوماتیک یا کنټرول سیسټمونه شامل کړي چې د ودانۍ مختلف فعالیتونه اداره او تنظیموي لکه د رڼا کنټرول، د انرژۍ مدیریت، HVAC (تودول، وینټیلیشن، او هوایی حالت)، او د لفټ کنټرول. دا سیسټمونه د انرژۍ موثریت، د اشغالګر آرامۍ، او عملیاتي اسانتیا ته وده ورکوي.<br><br>5. آډیو ویژول سیسټمونه: د ELV سیسټمونه کولی شي آډیو ویژول تجهیزات لکه د عامه ادرس سیسټمونه ، ملټي میډیا سیسټمونه ، د ویډیو کنفرانس سیسټمونه ، او ډیجیټل لاسلیکونه پوښي. دا سیسټمونه په ودانۍ یا پروژې کې مؤثره اړیکه، پریزنټشنونه، او ساتیرۍ وړوي.<br><br>6. د روښنايي سیسټمونه: د ELV د رڼا سیسټمونه معمولا د ټیټ ولټاژ د رڼا ټیکنالوژي لکه LED (د رڼا خپریدو ډایډ) روښانتیا لري، کوم چې د انرژي اغیزمن او هر اړخیز روښنايي اختیارونه وړاندې کوي. دا سیسټمونه ډیری وختونه د آرائشی یا تلفظ ر lightingا ، منظرې کولو ، یا خوندیتوب روښانتیا لپاره کارول کیږي.<br><br>د ملکي انجینرانو لپاره دا مهمه ده چې د پروژې ډیزاین او ساختماني مرحلو په جریان کې د ELV سیسټمونه په پام کې ونیسي، ځکه چې دا سیسټمونه ځانګړي کیبلینګ، تجهیزات، او زیربنا ته اړتیا لري. د بریښنایی انجینرانو او د ELV متخصص مشاورینو سره همغږي کول کولی شي په ټولیزه ودانۍ یا زیربنا ډیزاین کې د دې سیسټمونو مناسب ادغام او فعالیت تضمین کړي.",2023-06-08T10:38:40Z,0,0,neutral

@saadrao804,4,"sir Irfan Malik you said in this lecture that bard is very updated It can give you the latest answer according to the prompt but it can not go to the internet and collect data for you(you added). but here bard is saying something different. I am not trying find your mistakes, I am just correcting myself. I just want to clear my concept. so plz do not take it wrongly.<br>my prompt:<br>do you know you are better than chat gpt.<br>bard&#39;s response:<br>I am still under development, so I am not sure if I am better than Chatgpt. However, I do have some advantages over Chatgpt. For example, I am trained on a larger dataset of text and code, which means that I have a wider range of knowledge. &quot;I am also able to access and process real-time information from the internet, which makes me more up-to-date&quot;.<br><br>my prompt:<br>you mean that you can access real-time data from internet at the same time when user writes any prompt? <br>bard&#39;s response:<br>Yes, that is correct. I am able to access and process real-time information from the internet at the same time when a user writes a prompt. This means that I can provide up-to-date information, even if the prompt is about a current event or a topic that is changing rapidly.<br><br>For example, if a user asks me &quot;What is the latest news about the war in Ukraine?&quot;, I will be able to access the latest news articles from the internet and provide them with a summary of the latest developments.<br><br>my prompt:<br>if the article is posted 1 second ago then can you still access it?<br>bard&#39;s response:<br>Yes, I can still access an article that was posted 1 second before. I am able to do this because I am connected to a number of real-time data sources, such as newswires, social media platforms, and financial data providers. These sources are constantly updating their data, so I am able to access the latest information as soon as it is available.",2023-07-17T21:03:26Z,2,0,neutral

@JavaidBaber,4,"he current web page context is not related to your question. However, according to the BBC News1, the current political situation in Pakistan is polarized and tearing the country apart. The situation was sparked when Imran Khan was ousted from his position as prime minister in April 2022 in a vote of no confidence. Khan refused to accept it and his many supporters are confronting Pakistan’s politically elite1. According to the United States Institute of Peace2, Pakistan’s eruption into new political crisis this week elevates the risks — in South Asia and beyond — of instability in a nuclear-armed state that is also the world’s fifth most populous. The authorities’ arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan triggered a confrontation between his many supporters and Pakistan’s politically elite2.

My friend and I made blind glasses in the final year project of the university using AI, the purpose of which was to improve the life of the blind person, adding four features in it Object Detection, Face Detection, Text Detection, Distance measurement or Obstacle Detection. We worked day and night on this project due to lack of resources while living in Pakistan and completed this project in one year. Unfortunately, we did not get any response, support or any sponsor, otherwise we would have launched it officially.

I appreciate the effort you put into editing the videos and creating a playlist for easy access to the content.<br><br>I wanted to discuss a small issue I&#39;m facing regarding the notes and assignments for the course. As you mentioned, you usually send them via Gmail. However, I seem to be having trouble accessing the Google links you provide. It would be very helpful if you could consider an alternative method of sharing the notes and assignments.<br><br>I have a suggestion that might make it easier for all the students. Instead of sending the notes and assignments separately via Gmail, could you possibly include them in the description of each class video? This way, we can easily find the materials while watching the videos and refer to them whenever needed. It would save us the trouble of searching for the Google links and ensure that all the course resources are in one accessible place.<br><br>I understand that you may have your reasons for using Gmail to share the materials, but I believe this alternative approach would greatly benefit the entire class. I kindly request you to consider implementing this change to enhance the learning experience for all of us.<br><br>Thank you for your attention and consideration. I look forward to your response.<br><br>Best regards,  Sharjeel Khalid",2023-06-24T01:48:47Z,0,1,positive

Jazakumullah Khaira. <br>I am a freelancer and working in .Net technologies. I have 12+ years experience. I also want to learn AI by watching your videos. Videos are great but very sorry as  a professional and having 12+ years experience, I lost my tempo when you guys go too deep in basic concepts. If I forward them then I miss the practical work. So here are my suggestions  please. <br>a) Every video should have link of the practical work sheet (git or any source) that was done in that video. As well as link of the dataset if used.<br>b) In the description of the video, there should be outline that what is being tought in that lession. <br>In this way everyone novice will have clear path and can learn fast as a professional software engineer because I am pretty sure your purpose of these videos is to help others in an awsome way and not ranking of your youtube channel. <br><br>Again sir we cannot pay for your efforts but we can only pray for you and your whole Teams.<br>Jazakumullah Khaira.",2023-10-23T21:36:58Z,5,0,positive

@Shahidma58,16,"Aoa. I assure Xeven team that I am writing this comment with a highly positive mindset. Once I heard from a professor from a US university, there are two ways to prepare the question/quiz paper for the students, a: Test the ability of the student and b: To Fail the Student. In the last three or four quizzes I have observed that the second option is prevailing and encouraged while preparing the quizzes for this course. This may be OK while recruiting the people, but educating the crowd may discourage the students and verbal encouragement may not compensate. So, you are requested to kindly follow the option a.

@muhammadmaeen1734,23,"Subject: Request to Adjust Quiz Timing for AI Online Course<br><br>Dear , Sir Irfan Malik, Sir Sheraz, Sir Haris and Xeven Solution team<br><br>I hope this message finds you well. I am currently enrolled in your AI online course on YouTube and have found the lectures to be incredibly insightful and informative. I truly appreciate the effort and knowledge you are sharing with your audience.<br><br>I wanted to bring to your attention a minor concern I encountered while participating in the course. As a practicing individual, I ensure that I offer my evening prayers, including Eisha Prayer. During one of the lectures, I had to pause the video halfway to perform my prayer and resumed watching afterward. Unfortunately, this caused me to miss the quiz session that followed the lecture.<br><br>I understand that timing can be a challenge when catering to a global audience, each with their own routines and schedules. However, I kindly request if it would be possible to either extend the duration of the quiz sessions or adjust the timing of the quizzes to accommodate individuals who may have interruptions due to their religious practices.<br><br>This adjustment would greatly help learners like me who are committed to both their education and their religious obligations. It would ensure that we do not miss out on the opportunity to participate in the quiz and further reinforce our understanding of the course material.<br><br>Once again, I want to express my gratitude for the effort you have put into creating this course. Your dedication to helping us learn about AI is truly commendable. I hope you will consider my request and find a suitable solution that benefits all participants.<br><br>Thank you for your time and consideration.<br><br>Best regards,<br>Muhammad Maeen",2023-08-16T17:41:23Z,0,0,positive

@umersufyan7695,29,"Thank you very much for this great lecture, Context (I have jumped directly to Lecture 28) <br>Q1- The way context building by providing all previous chat to chatModel would be very very costly by the day end , and with DB involvement It go much higher than expectation. Is there way to reduce this payload while maintaining complete context, I mean With API each time a new request created, If we look into Socket if there is I am not sure, it could save us context, since that will be based on one live connection right? without sending over and over all chat history, If I am wrong as I may wrong, What is the best solution I am sure this is not something will be acceptable in long run.<br>Thank you once again for great effort Sir Dr Shiraz, and Sir Irfan and Sir Haris.",2023-10-09T11:05:35Z,0,0,positive

@EHASSAN-eu5lx,33,"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the potential of AI and Google&#39;s capabilities. However, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, I don&#39;t have information about the specific website or tool you&#39;ve mentioned, &quot;gsuperupdate,&quot; and its capabilities. It&#39;s also important to exercise caution when using AI tools from unofficial sources, as the quality and accuracy of results can vary widely.<br><br>When it comes to generating innovative ideas and achieving success, it&#39;s essential to remember that AI tools can assist in various aspects of research, data analysis, and content creation, but they may not guarantee the &quot;perfect&quot; idea or success in itself. Success often involves a combination of creativity, hard work, determination, and adaptability.<br><br>Here are some general tips for generating innovative ideas:<br><br>1. <b>*Explore Diverse Perspectives:*</b> Engage with people from different backgrounds and industries to gain new insights and perspectives.<br><br>2. <b>*Stay Informed:*</b> Keep up with industry trends, emerging technologies, and global developments. Understanding what&#39;s happening in the world can inspire new ideas.<br><br>3. <b>*Problem-Solving:*</b> Focus on solving real-world problems or addressing pain points for your target audience. Innovative ideas often emerge from addressing unmet needs.<br><br>4. <b>*Collaboration:*</b> Collaborate with others, as diverse teams often come up with more creative solutions.<br><br>5. <b>*Continuous Learning:*</b> Never stop learning. Acquiring new knowledge and skills can lead to fresh ideas.<br><br>6. <b>*Experimentation:*</b> Don&#39;t be afraid to experiment and take calculated risks. Not every idea will succeed, but failure can lead to valuable lessons.<br><br>7. <b>*Feedback:*</b> Seek feedback from peers, mentors, or potential users. Constructive criticism can help refine your ideas.<br><br>8. <b>*Persistence:*</b> Success often involves overcoming challenges and setbacks. Stay persistent in pursuing your goals.<br><br>Remember that innovation and success are iterative processes, and there is no one-size-fits-all formula. While AI tools can assist in various tasks, the human element of creativity, critical thinking, and strategic decision-making remains essential. Always verify the credibility and legitimacy of AI tools and websites before relying on them for important tasks.",2023-09-21T13:12:02Z,0,0,positive
